Wanna see this in action ? check out this demo... Zoe really shines when it comes to interacting with cloud hosted kafka clusters (kubernetes, AWS, etc.) due to its ability to offload consumption and execution to kubernetes pods or lambda functions (more runners will be supported in the future). Status Zoe is not GA yet. It has been open sourced very recently and is actively being improved toward stabilization. Documentation is also still to be done. That said, we are already using it at Adevinta and you can already start trying it if you are not afraid of digging into the code to solve some eventual undocumented problems :) . Key features Here are some of the most interesting features of zoe : Consume kafka topics from a specific point in time (ex. from the last hour). Filter data based on content (ex. filter events with id == '12345' ). Supports offloading consumption of data to multiple lambda functions, kubernetes pods, etc. for parallelism. Monitor consumer groups' offsets. Upload avro schemas from a .avsc or .avdl file using different naming strategies. ... and more.

Only few platforms are supported for now but more will come in the future. The platform packages are self contained. They ship with their own version of the java virtual machine (thus the higher size of the package). The host machine does not need to have it's own java runtime. The platform packages are built with jpackage and JDK 14. Ubuntu / Debian Download the .deb package of the zoe CLI from the latest release page and install it using dpkg : ZOE_VERSION=0.3.0 # change it to the suitable version curl -L \"https://github.com/adevinta/zoe/releases/download/v${ZOE_VERSION}/zoe_${ZOE_VERSION}-1_amd64.deb\" -o /tmp/zoe.deb sudo dpkg -i /tmp/zoe.deb Add the /opt/zoe/bin into your path by appending the following line in your .bashrc (or .zshrc ) : PATH=$PATH:/opt/zoe/bin Init zoe configuration : zoe config init You are now ready to use zoe. Go to the ./tutorials folder to start learning zoe. Centos Download the .rpm package of the zoe CLI from the latest release page and install it using dpkg : ZOE_VERSION=0.3.0 # change it to the suitable version sudo rpm -i \"https://github.com/adevinta/zoe/releases/download/v${ZOE_VERSION}/zoe-${ZOE_VERSION}-1.x86_64.rpm\" Add the /opt/zoe/bin into your path by appending the following line in your .bashrc (or .zshrc ) : PATH=$PATH:/opt/zoe/bin Init zoe configuration : zoe config init You are now ready to use zoe. Go to the ./tutorials folder to start learning zoe. Manual tarball install (requires a JDK on the host machine) Java 11 or higher is required in order to install the runtime-less tarball packages. They only ship with the Zoe CLI jar. If you don't have java installed already, you can use sdkman for an easy install and version management of the JDK. If you don't want to install java you can try one of the platform packages provided above. Once java is installed, proceed with the following steps : Download the runtime-less zip or tar package of the zoe CLI from the latest release page and uncompress it into your home directory (or wherever you wish) ZOE_VERSION=0.3.0 # change it to the suitable version curl -L \"https://github.com/adevinta/zoe/releases/download/v${ZOE_VERSION}/zoe-${ZOE_VERSION}.tar.gz\" | tar -zx -C $HOME Add the $HOME/zoe/bin into your path by appending the following line in your .bashrc (or .zshrc ) : PATH=$PATH:$HOME/zoe/bin Init zoe configuration : zoe config init You are now ready to use zoe.
