# Enable auto completion

To enable auto completion in `bash`, you can execute the following command:

```bash
source <(_ZOE_COMPLETE=bash zoe)
```

Or if you are using zsh:

```bash
source <(_ZOE_COMPLETE=zsh zoe)
```

To make this auto completion permanent, you can add the previous line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.
