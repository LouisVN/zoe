# Install Zoe CLI

There are different ways to install zoe depending on your needs and the platform you are using :

- [Platform package install](package.md) : Self contained platform packages (`.deb`, `.rpm`, etc.) that ships zoe with its own version of the java virtual machine. This doesn't require that host machine to have its own JDK. This is the easiest and the recommended way to install zoe (if your platform is supported).
- [Manual tarball install](tarball.md) : Supports all platforms. However, this requires the host machine to have a JDK 11 or higher.
- [Docker](docker.md) : You can also use zoe using docker. We provide built-in image on each release.
