# Getting started

This getting started guide will show you step by step how to efficiently use zoe to interact with your kafka clusters.

- [Producing data into topics](produce.md): We will use zoe to write some json data into Kafka. The dataset used is a funny one from the Cat Facts API.
- [Reading data from topics](consume.md): You will see the basics of reading data with zoe. We will cover the filtering basics, formatting and pretty printing. This part will hover over some of the most powerful features of zoe...
